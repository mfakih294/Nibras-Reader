# Nibras Mobile

**Nibras Mobile** is an Android application that connects to a Nibras Desktop system (e.g. on the same WIFI network), and gets the bookmarked records in key modules.

* It allows the user to enter quick one-line notes that will be synced to Nibras Desktop on user's choice.


* To use Nibras Mobile, the user has to specify first the IP and port of Nibras Desktop. Then, when clicking 'Sync', all bookmarked records will be available for reading on mobile.
